                <p>World Exercise System began in the early 1980s when the concept of personal training started sweeping the nation.</p>

                <p>World Exercise System began developing and teaching trainers every aspect of the personal training and health club businesses. Over the past 30 years, we have designed and built multiple personal training studios and health clubs one of which was a Gold’s Gym franchise. </p>

                <p>We have developed our system to help trainers become the best they can be. We have crafted our system by working hands-on with clients over the past 30 years which has accumulated to over 100,000 hours of personal training. We have researched and developed our own work-out model that we will teach you to use with any type of client.</p>

                <p>Our concept is simple yet effective. We have taken over 30 years to perfect what we do and we will teach you the same concepts which made us successful.</p>

                <h2>Client Testimonials</h2>
                <p>World Exercise Systems requirements are vastly different than other personal training certification companies. We will not teach you anything that we do not use with our own clients. We are not doctors, so we do not have to know doctor terms and doctors are not trainers so they do not have to know our business either.</p>

                <p>Below are just a few of our testimonials from past clients. They have seen the value and expertise offered by World Exercise System and are proof that our methods and certification work!</p>

                                    I began a lifelong journey of fitness with World Exercises System’s owner over thirty years ago. 
                           Today, at 62, I’m still  working out with him and have never felt better! 
                           Utilizing the program is incredible, motivating, and it makes perfect sense. 
                           He taught me that each work-out prepares me for my next work-out.

                                    Because of the World Exercise System, I’m in the best shape of my life at 58 years old. 
                            The 324-E fitness philosophy has allowed me to have the mindset to be consistent with my workouts even with my demanding schedule.  
                            As a result, I have achieved and maintain my fitness goals.

                            Four years ago, I was 50 pounds overweight and miserable. 
                            The owner of World Exercise System started me on a fitness foundation building program, taught me proper conditioning protocol and intensity levels. 
                            I highly recommend World Exercise System to anyone with interest in becoming a trainer.
