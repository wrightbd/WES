Most sites only require you to pass a test to receive a certificate showing you have the knowledge. World Exercise Systems requires passing a test as well, but we also require a personal workout video to show that you can teach people the proper techniques. This shows that not only do you know the terminology, but you know how to properly use the techniques with your clients.">
