                <p>Kirk started working out 4 days a week in 1978 when he was only fourteen years old. In 1981, he played football for LSU and became a member of the 1200 pound club. In 1984, He started his professional career managing private health clubs and in 1985, he began the first personal training business in the south. Between the years of 1986-1994, Kirk was involved in building Goudeau’s Health Club and the first Gold’s Gym in Baton Rouge. In 1996, Kirk was contracted to design a line of fitness equipment that was used in public schools and government businesses throughout Louisiana.</p>

                <p>With all of his experience in the health club and personal training industry, Kirk opened up Definitions Personal Training Center in 1994. Kirk didn’t have any partners in this business other than his wife. In 1998, they opened up a second location in Baton Rouge. In 2000, Kirk was asked to perform an eight-week fitness segment on WAFB 33. Kirk experienced un-predictable success with Definitions allowing him to open up his third location on LSU’s campus in 2006. This location was a fifteen thousand square foot mega health club that catered to LSU’s student base. </p>

                <p>Throughout the thirty-eight years in the personal training industry, Kirk has trained celebrities like Dennis Quad and James Spader, pro-athletes like Brian Kinchen and Kevin Mawoe, as well as housewives, husbands, kids, and business people. </p>

                <p>In 2010, Kirk sold all of his health clubs to focus on World Exercise System.</p>

                <p>World Exercise System has been a thirty-year creation of Kirk. His passion for getting people in shape and keeping them in shape has shaped this business into what it is today. When you have a passion for something then it isn’t work, it’s a joy. The idea of W.E.S. has been there all along. Kirk has trained hundreds of trainers over the past thirty years through Goudeau’s Health clubs, Gold’s Gym, and Definitions Fitness Center. He has taught every aspect of the business from shaking hands to selling fitness packages to training, motivating, and beyond. </p>

                <p>We have paved the way for you-made the mistakes for you, learned what you need to know, and have eliminated what you don’t need to know. </p>

                <p>In 1991, Kirk started another personal training business for Gold’s gym. Today, 25 years later, Kirk is still training some old Gold’s gym members. “Kirk has kept me motivated and in shape so I can continue working with horses.”- Chat Kleinpeter.</p>
