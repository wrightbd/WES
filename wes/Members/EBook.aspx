                There are some similarities between training athletes and training the general public. However, there are also some vast differences. 
                It does not matter how in shape a client is, whether they are a current athlete, former athlete, or have never been an athlete 
                our World Exercise System’s motto applies to everyone. “Each work-out gets you ready for your next work-out.”
