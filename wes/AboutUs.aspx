                <p class="lead">Our concept is simple yet effective. We have taken over 30 years to perfect what we do and we will teach you the same concepts which made us successful.</p>
                <p>World Exercise System began in the early 1980s when the concept of personal training started sweeping the nation. World Exercise System began developing and teaching trainers every aspect of the personal training and health club businesses. 
                Over the past 30 years, we have designed and built multiple personal training studios and health clubs one of which was a Gold’s Gym franchise. World Exercise System has designed, built and sold its own line of fitness equipment and also started an international 24 hour Personal Training studio franchise. 
                One testament of World Exercise System’s legacy comes from Dr. Chat Kleinpeter:</p>

                    <p>I became a client of the owner of World Exercise System in Gold’s Gym over 30 years ago and I am still being personally trained by him today. He is a great motivator, trainer, and teacher.</p>

                <p>We have worked hands-on with clients over the past 30 years which has accumulated to over 100,000 hours of personal training.  
                We do not create hypotheticals when it comes to fitness. We have researched and developed our own work-out model that we will teach you to use with any type of client. 
                World Exercise Systems requirements are vastly different than other personal training certification companies. We will not teach you anything that we do not use with our own clients. 
                We are not doctors, so we do not have to know doctor terms and doctors are not trainers so they do not have to know our business either. Doctors trust our expertise. 
                For example:</p>

            <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-10">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I have been a client of World Exercise System for over 10 years now and today’s work-outs, just like they were 10 years ago, are amazing. The brand that World Exercise System developed is spot on.</p>
