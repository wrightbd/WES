                            At World Exercise System, we will teach you a lot of great information about personal training and working out. Our personal training certification encompasses all areas of fitness, 
                        from training athletes to senior citizens along with how to run your own personal training business. When you receive our certificate you will be qualified to train anybody, anywhere, 
                        and anytime. It is simple; we exercise, eat right, and do it every day. You are going to teach your clients how to do the same. There will be no wasted time on terms you will never use 
                        in your day-to-day operations. You only need two things to thrive in this business: a love for people and a love for fitness.

                            Our system is proven and has been effective over the past 30 years. Our system is designed to help you focus on your clients by taking out all of the guess work, so you can get them into shape. 
                        You, as a CPT, cannot have system failure. After you receive our certification, the only decision you have to make is whether you will work for yourself or an existing health club. 
                        Personal training is an exciting and amazing business. Just imagine getting paid to do what you’re passionate about.
